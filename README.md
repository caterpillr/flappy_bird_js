# flappy_bird_js
Little JavaScript browser game

Browser version of Flappy Bird written using pure JS, HTML and CSS. It is an interesting implementation that interacts with native html elements (divs, blocks, etc.), and fue to its nuances the game is a bit tricky :)

Game menu : (you can notice a few checkboxes, first one makes list of some live parameters visible, second one better not to touch, just decorative feature)
